## About This Project

This application was developed as a hands-on learning exercise. The primary goal was to build and deploy a full-stack application featuring real-time communication, manage a simple user session system, and understand the deployment process on a modern cloud platform. Users can create chatrooms and let the other users join their private room by letting them know the unique chatroom name. 

---

## Current Features

* **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant message delivery using Flask-SocketIO.
* **Dynamic Chat Rooms:** Ability to create and join unique chat rooms.
* **Simple User Authentication:** A basic login/signup system for session demonstration.
* **Typing Indicators:** See when other users in the room are typing.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO
* **Web Server:** Gunicorn with Eventlet
* **Deployment:** Render
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Current Status & Future Goals

This project is a **work-in-progress**. The current implementation uses a simple `users.json` file for user storage as a temporary placeholder, which is not suitable for production.

Future development goals include:
* Transition from `users.json` to a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
* Implement password hashing for proper security.
* Enhance the user interface and add more chat features.
